Hello doctor, I am in pain

Game about patients visiting a psychologist.

3D Minesweeper grid + Deckbuilder
  - each turn you draw cards which can give you 
	-probing (clicks)
	-notes(flags)
	-curses
	-stress/relaxation
	-trust/distrust

  - game ends when you run out of probes, stress or trust meter

  - minesweeper map is inlayed into patients head
  - short dialogue of patient reacting to good/bad events
  - maybe you need trust for deeper layers?
  - clicking on mines gives curses to the deck, 
	but maybe some add over time
  - cards are conversation topics which can 
	turn into good/bad memories
